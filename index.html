    <p>
      We are a non-profit organization that focuses on the health and well being
      of the homeless. We try to give people housing, food, and clothes that fit
      them to the best of or ability. But since we rely on donations and our own
      money to push forth this movement, we ask you the reader to please donate
      anything you can whether it is as small as a penny we are grateful for
      your contributions.
